- [ ] All Relations are bi-directional where noted
- [ ] Daily Log "Date" property is **Date only** (no time)
- [ ] Finance "Amount" property is formatted as **Currency**
- [ ] CRM "Email" property is type **Email** (not text)
- [ ] CRM "Phone" property is type **Phone** (not text)

---

## üîÑ After Fixing

Once you've made these changes:

1. **Re-run the test script**: `npm run sync:calendar`
2. **Create a test task**: Name it "Test Sync", Status = "Active", Due = Tomorrow 2pm
3. **Run sync again**: Should create calendar event
4. **Check Google Calendar**: Event should appear

---

## üìù Notes

- The web dashboard relies on these exact property names and types
- Incorrect types will cause sync failures
- Missing properties will show as blank in the UI
- Formulas are optional but highly recommended for auto-prioritization

**Estimated time to fix**: 10-15 minutes

**Priority order**:
1. Fix Tasks "Due" to Date type (CRITICAL)
2. Add Tasks "calendar_event_id" property (CRITICAL)
3. Fix other property types (HIGH)
4. Add formulas (MEDIUM)
5. Verify relations (LOW - can do later)
