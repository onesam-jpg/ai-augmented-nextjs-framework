## ❓ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**Solution:**

- Use existing templates you already have
- Batch work: 1 hour before work each day
- First $ removes the excuse

### **"I'm not sure what to put in my course"**

**Solution:**
- What do new notaries ask you?
- What mistakes did you make starting out?
- What do you wish you knew then?
- Interview 3 new notaries - ask what they struggle with

### **"I'm afraid to charge money for this"**

**Solution:**
- This is resistance (fear-based avoidance)
- Add to Resistance Tracker in Notion
- Intervention: Start with $1 (prove the concept)
- Then $10, then $47, then $297
