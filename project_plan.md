## Checkpoint 3: Agentic Workflow & Governance Setup

**Goal**: Establish AI agent governance, task tracking, and plan-first workflow.

### Tasks
- [x] Create `copilot_instructions.md` with execution rules and output standards
- [x] Create enhanced `claude.md` with comprehensive AI-Augmented Development Architect prompt
- [x] Structure `project_plan.md` with 4-checkpoint framework
- [x] Implement task tracking system (checkboxes, status updates)
- [x] Define Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD) workflows
- [x] Document security & privacy guardrails
- [x] Add session continuity files (`SESSION_NOTES.md`, `PROGRESS.md`)

### Review (Checkpoint 3)
**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **claude.md** created with:
  - Role definition: Expert AI-Augmented Development Architect
  - CoT analysis framework (analyze ‚Üí trade-offs ‚Üí risks ‚Üí plan)
  - CAD workflow (read state ‚Üí decompose ‚Üí update ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí track ‚Üí review)
  - Atomic implementation principles
  - Security guardrails (least privilege, sandboxing, no secrets)
  - LLM selection strategy (local for sensitive, cloud for scale)
  - Dependency management rules
  - Next.js specific guidelines
  - Checkpoint tracking protocol
  - Anti-patterns and quick reference

- ‚úÖ **copilot_instructions.md** covers:
  - Execution rules (think first, plan mode, small diffs)
  - Output standards (copy-pasteable code, file references)
  - Security & privacy guardrails
  - MCP usage guidelines
  - Next.js conventions

- ‚úÖ **Session tracking system**:
  - `SESSION_NOTES.md` - Session-to-session continuity
  - `PROGRESS.md` - High-level status dashboard
  - `project_plan.md` - Detailed checkpoint tracking (this file)

**Architecture Decisions**:
1. **Dual Governance Files**: `claude.md` (comprehensive) + `copilot_instructions.md` (concise)
2. **Plan-First Workflow**: Always update `project_plan.md` before major changes
3. **Security-First**: MCP servers only in Dev Containers with least privilege
4. **Transparency**: Every checkpoint includes review with changes/risks/next steps

**Risks**: None

**Next Steps**: Apply governance in practice, test plan-first workflow

---

## Checkpoint 4: Advanced Agent Configuration (MCP/Background)

**Goal**: Configure MCP servers securely and set up background coding agent environment.

### Tasks
- [x] Create `mcp.config.json` with filesystem server
- [x] Document MCP security warnings (full system access, code execution risks)
- [ ] Review and optimize MCP server `root` path (currently `/workspace` - consider narrowing)
- [ ] Add security documentation to MCP config (done partially in claude.md)
- [x] Create `copilot_setup_steps.yaml` for GitHub Actions environment
- [ ] Update `copilot_setup_steps.yaml` to match npm/pnpm fallback strategy
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/nextjs-e2e.yml`)
- [ ] Fix GitHub Actions to use npm when pnpm unavailable (Windows compatibility)
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Push to GitHub and test Actions workflow
- [ ] Connect Vercel via GitHub App
- [ ] Test Preview + Production deployments
- [ ] Verify Lighthouse CI integration

### Review (Checkpoint 4) - IN PROGRESS
**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **MCP Configuration** (`mcp.config.json`):
  - Filesystem server configured with `/workspace` root
  - Read/write permissions set
  - Security notes included
  - Documented extensively in `claude.md`

- ‚úÖ **Background Agent Setup** (`copilot_setup_steps.yaml`):
  - Node 20 + Python 3.11 environment
  - Automated dependency installation
  - Supports both npm and pnpm

- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/nextjs-e2e.yml`):
  - E2E testing with Playwright
  - Sharded execution (2 runners)
  - Next.js build cache
  - Playwright report artifacts
  - Currently configured for pnpm

- ‚úÖ **Deployment Scripts**:
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` for Vercel CLI deployment
  - `vercel.json` configuration

**Pending**:
- ‚è≥ GitHub Actions needs npm fallback (currently requires pnpm)
- ‚è≥ Git repository not initialized
- ‚è≥ Vercel connection not established
- ‚è≥ CI/CD pipeline not tested end-to-end
- ‚è≥ MCP server scope could be narrowed (consider `/workspace/app` instead of `/workspace`)

**Current Blocker**:
- pnpm not available on Windows host (Corepack permission error)
- Need to update workflows and configs to use npm as primary on Windows

**Security Considerations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MCP filesystem server has broad `/workspace` access - acceptable for Dev Container isolation
- ‚úÖ Server documented to run only in containers/VMs
- ‚úÖ Permissions explicitly defined (read/write)
- üîÑ Consider adding GitHub MCP server for enhanced repo management

**Architecture Decisions**:
1. **Package Manager Strategy**: pnpm preferred, npm fallback for Windows compatibility
2. **MCP Security**: Servers isolated to Dev Containers, documented risks
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions ‚Üí Vercel GitHub App (no tokens, auto previews)
4. **Testing**: Playwright E2E sharded across 2 runners for performance

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `mcp.config.json` - MCP server configuration
- `copilot_setup_steps.yaml` - Background agent environment
- `.github/workflows/nextjs-e2e.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Vercel deployment automation
- `lighthouserc.json` - Performance budgets

**Risks**:
- üü° **Medium**: Workflow may fail on Windows without pnpm setup
- üü° **Medium**: MCP server broad permissions (mitigated by container isolation)

**Next Steps**:
1. Update GitHub Actions workflow to use npm (Windows compatibility)
2. Update `copilot_setup_steps.yaml` to prioritize npm
3. Initialize git repository
4. Create GitHub repository
5. Test Actions workflow with real PR
6. Connect Vercel and verify deployments
7. Run full E2E test suite
8. Consider narrowing MCP server scope if needed
