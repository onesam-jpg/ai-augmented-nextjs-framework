# Session Notes & Progress Tracker

> **Purpose**: Track progress, decisions, and next steps across Claude Code sessions

---

## Current Session: 2025-10-08

### Session Goals
- [x] Review previous work and restore original AI-Augmented Development Architect prompt
- [x] Optimize governance files and project planning
- [x] Complete GitHub repository setup and test CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Document complete framework for future sessions

### What Was Done
1. **Restored Original Framework Vision**
   - Reviewed comprehensive AI-Augmented Development Architect prompt
   - Aligned all governance files with original 4-checkpoint structure

2. **Created Enhanced Governance System**
   - ✅ `claude.md` - Comprehensive AI agent instructions (CoT, CAD, security)
   - ✅ `MCP_SECURITY.md` - Detailed MCP server security guide
   - ✅ Enhanced `project_plan.md` with full checkpoint tracking
   - ✅ `SESSION_NOTES.md` + `PROGRESS.md` for session continuity

3. **Updated Technical Configuration**
   - ✅ Added AI Toolkit extension to devcontainer
   - ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow for npm compatibility (removed pnpm dependency)
   - ✅ Updated all configs for Windows + npm support

4. **Git & GitHub Setup**
   - ✅ Initialized git repository
   - ✅ Created GitHub repo: `onesam-jpg/ai-augmented-nextjs-framework`
   - ✅ Pushed initial commit with full framework
   - ✅ Fixed CI/CD workflow (removed lockfile cache dependency)
   - ✅ Pushed fix commit

### Current State
- **Project**: AI-Augmented Development Framework (Complete architecture)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + MCP + AI Toolkit
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E (sharded) + Accessibility tests configured
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow active (npm-based, no pnpm dependency)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/onesam-jpg/ai-augmented-nextjs-framework
- **Status**: Framework 85% complete - needs local testing & Vercel connection

### Blockers / Issues
- ⚠️ **No dependencies installed yet** - Need to run `npm install` locally
- ⚠️ **No package-lock.json** - Will be generated on first `npm install`
- ⚠️ **CI/CD workflow** - Will pass once lockfile exists and tests can run

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Install Dependencies Locally**
   ```bash
   cd VSCode_AI_Framework_Setup
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate package-lock.json**
   - Commit the lockfile to repo
   - Re-enable npm cache in GitHub Actions

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev              # Verify Next.js app runs
   npm run test:e2e         # Run Playwright tests
   ```

4. **Fix Any Test Issues**
   - App needs to be built/running for E2E tests
   - May need to add `npm run build` step before tests

5. **Connect Vercel**
   - Link GitHub repo via Vercel GitHub App
   - Configure environment variables (optional: CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL)
   - Test Preview and Production deployments

6. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Install AI Toolkit extension manually
   - Configure local LLM (llama.vscode)
   - Narrow MCP server scope from `/workspace` to `/workspace/app`

### Notes & Decisions
- **Package Manager**: npm (Windows compatible, pnpm optional in Dev Container)
- **Governance**: Dual files (claude.md comprehensive, copilot_instructions.md concise)
- **Security**: MCP servers sandboxed in Dev Container, documented risks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → Vercel GitHub App (no tokens, auto previews)
- **Framework Philosophy**: Plan-first, CoT analysis, CAD workflow, security-first
