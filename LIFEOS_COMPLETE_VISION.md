#### **4. Resistance Detection & Intervention**

**Database: Resistance Tracker**

**Resistance Patterns to Monitor:**

1. **Procrastination Patterns**
   - Tasks repeatedly rescheduled
   - Habits with low completion rates
   - Projects stuck in "To Do" for weeks
   - **Alert:** "You've rescheduled 'Create course' 5 times. Resistance detected."

2. **Self-Sabotage Indicators**
   - Success → sudden setback pattern
   - Upper limit problem (things going well, then crash)
   - Breakthrough opportunity → avoidance
   - **Alert:** "Income hit $10K, then you stopped marketing. Pattern detected."

3. **Fear-Based Avoidance**
   - High-impact tasks with perfect conditions never met
   - "Waiting for" that never resolves
   - Analysis paralysis (over-researching, never doing)
   - **Alert:** "You've researched YouTube strategy for 40 hours but not uploaded. Fear of judgment?"

4. **Identity Conflict**
   - Actions contradicting stated identity
   - Imposter syndrome signals
   - "I'm not ready" beliefs
   - **Alert:** "You say 'I am an entrepreneur' but spend 80% time in employee mode. Misalignment."

5. **Energy Depletion**
   - Consistent low energy ratings
   - High stress/anxiety scores
   - Burnout risk indicators
   - **Alert:** "Energy levels declining 3 weeks straight. Need recovery protocol."

**Resistance Detection Algorithm:**

```javascript
function detectResistance(task) {
  let resistanceScore = 0;
  let resistanceType = [];

  // Procrastination detection
  if (task.timesRescheduled >= 3) {
    resistanceScore += 20;
    resistanceType.push("Procrastination");
  }

  // Importance vs completion mismatch
  if (task.importance >= 8 && task.completionRate < 0.3) {
    resistanceScore += 30;
    resistanceType.push("High-impact avoidance");
  }

  // Perfect conditions excuse
  if (task.status === "Waiting For" && daysSince(task.waitingSince) > 14) {
    resistanceScore += 25;
    resistanceType.push("Perfectionism/Control");
  }

  // Energy mismatch (task requires high energy, always scheduled when low)
  if (task.energyRequired === "High" && averageEnergyWhenScheduled < 5) {
    resistanceScore += 15;
    resistanceType.push("Poor scheduling");
  }

  // Fear-based (visible actions: over-research, never execute)
  if (task.research_hours > 10 && task.execution_hours === 0) {
    resistanceScore += 35;
    resistanceType.push("Analysis paralysis / Fear");
  }

  if (resistanceScore >= 50) {
    return {
      alert: true,
      score: resistanceScore,
      types: resistanceType,
      intervention: suggestIntervention(resistanceType)
    };
  }
}
```

**Intervention Matching:**

When resistance detected, system suggests specific interventions:

| Resistance Type | Intervention |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Procrastination** | - Break into 2-minute minimum viable action<br>- Use Pomodoro (just 25 min)<br>- Accountability partner check-in<br>- Temptation bundling (pair with reward) |
| **Fear of Judgment** | - Private launch first (test with friends)<br>- Reframe: "Learning opportunity"<br>- Pull from Cookie Jar (past wins)<br>- 40% Rule (it's scarier than it is hard) |
| **Perfectionism** | - Set "good enough" standard<br>- Time-box the task (stop at 2 hours)<br>- "Done is better than perfect" reminder<br>- Iterate philosophy (V1 → V2 → V3) |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | - Research FREEZE (no more input)<br>- Bias toward action<br>- 80/20 rule (good enough info)<br>- "Start ugly" mindset |
| **Energy Depletion** | - Mandatory recovery day<br>- Reschedule to high-energy time<br>- Delegate to someone else<br>- Question if task is essential |
| **Identity Conflict** | - Rewrite identity statement<br>- Journal: "What would [Best Self] do?"<br>- Mental rehearsal (Psycho-Cybernetics)<br>- Small identity-consistent action daily |
| **Upper Limit** | - Recognize pattern (Gay Hendricks)<br>- Increase "thermostat" setting<br>- Normalize new level of success<br>- Expand capacity gradually |

**Weekly Check-in Questions:**
1. "What evidence showed up this week that I'm becoming Best Self?"
2. "What habits did Best Self practice this week?"
3. "Where did resistance show up? How did I respond?"
4. "What's the smallest next step toward Best Self?"
5. "Who did I connect with that Best Self would know?"

**Monthly Transformation Review:**
- Update Current Self snapshot (data-driven)
- Review Best Self vision (still accurate?)
- Analyze gap closure rate
- Celebrate progress (identity votes cast)
- Address stuck areas (resistance interventions)
- Adjust roadmap if needed

## 📈 **BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS SYSTEM**

### **Database: Opportunity Evaluation Matrix**

Every business idea, investment, partnership gets scored:

**Opportunity Scoring Algorithm:**

```javascript
function scoreOpportunity(opp) {
  let score = 0;

  // 1. Time Freedom (most important)
  score += opp.hoursRequiredWeekly <= 5 ? 25 : 0;
  score += opp.scalableWithoutYou ? 20 : 0;

  // 2. Income Potential
  score += opp.monthlyPotential >= 10000 ? 20 : 0;
  score += opp.passiveIncome ? 15 : 0;

  // 3. Leverage
  score += opp.systemizable ? 10 : 0;
  score += opp.delegatable ? 10 : 0;

  // 4. Startup Cost
  score += opp.startupCost <= 5000 ? 10 : 0;

  // 5. Skill Match
  score += opp.usesExistingSkills ? 10 : 0;

  // 6. Exit Potential
  score += opp.sellable ? 10 : 0;

  return {
    totalScore: score,
    rating: score >= 70 ? "HIGH PRIORITY" :
            score >= 40 ? "MEDIUM" : "LOW",
    recommendation: generateRecommendation(opp, score)
  };
}
```

**Example Opportunities Scored:**

| Opportunity | Time Freedom | Income | Leverage | Cost | Score | Rating |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Notary Network | ✅ 5hrs/wk | ✅ $3K | ✅ Yes | ✅ Low | 85 | HIGH ⭐ |

| Rental Property | ✅ 2hrs/wk | ⚠️ $1.5K | ✅ Yes (PM) | ❌ High | 65 | MEDIUM |
| Local Franchise | ❌ 60hrs/wk | ⚠️ $10K | ⚠️ Eventually | ❌ High | 35 | LOW ❌ |

**Decision Matrix:**
- HIGH (70-100): Pursue immediately, prioritize resources
- MEDIUM (40-69): Consider if strategic fit, test small
- LOW (0-39): Avoid or delegate entirely
