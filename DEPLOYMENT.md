## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Script says NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID not found"
- Make sure you added the page ID to `.env`
- Make sure there's no space before or after the ID
- Make sure you saved the `.env` file

### "Error: Unauthorized"
- Make sure you shared your Notion "Life OS" page with your integration
- Check that `NOTION_API_KEY` in `.env` is correct

### "Agent not finding opportunities"
- This is normal - the agent template uses example data
- Real API integration comes later (Zillow, Flippa, Google Trends)
- For now, manually add opportunities you discover

### "Can't connect to Google Calendar"
- Your OAuth is already configured, this shouldn't happen
- If it does, re-run: `node scripts/authorize-google-calendar.js`
